	<p>Olympic wrestler Vinesh Phogat on Thursday alleged that the Delhi police had withdrawn security from the women who are scheduled to testify in court against former Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP leader Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh in connection with the sexual assault case lodged against him.
	She also tagged the official handles of the Delhi Police, Delhi Commission for Women, and the National Commission for Women in a post on X.
	In response to her post, DCP (New Delhi) Devesh Kumar Mahla said that while the security had not been withdrawn, the responsibility to guard the wrestlers had been entrusted to the Haryana police from hereon forth, as the wrestlers are residents of that State. “The assigned Delhi Police PSOs misunderstood this decision and got delayed in reporting today. The situation has been rectified. Security cover continues,” he added. </p>

 <h1><b><u> ED attaches ₹19.39 crore in assets linked to operators of instant-loan apps</u></b></h1>
 <img src=C:\Users\veera\Downloads\ed.jpg alt="ED" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
 <p>The Enforcement Directorate has provisionally attached ₹ 19.39 crore in bank balances, and fixed deposits belonging to various entities connected with certain instant-loan apps.The agency is conducting a probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act which is based on 118 First Information Reports registered by the Telangana police against 242 instant loan mobile applications. It is alleged, that certain fintech companies were running numerous loan apps charging steep processing fees, exorbitant interest rates and penalties from borrowers.The loan apps were being used for non-banking finance business without valid licences from the Reserve Bank of India or were utilising licences of defunct, dormant, non-functional companies.While sanctioning the loans, contact details, photos and personal data were being accepted through the loan apps. This data was then misused through tele-caller companies to recover outstanding loan amounts by abusing borrowers and their families and also by sending objectionable images of borrowers to their contacts with derogatory remarks. The borrowers were urged to take other loans from related loan applications to repay existing loans creating a debt trap situation,” said the agency.

Chinese directors
The ED investigation revealed that certain mobile apps — such as “Online Loan”, “Rupiya Bus”, “Flip Cash”, “Rupee Smart”, etc. were linked to Nimisha Finance India Private Limited and Skyline Innovation Technology (India) Private Limited, a fintech company with Chinese directors, and the alleged proceeds of crime were generated via lending business through these mobile apps.

According to the agency, Skyline had an agreement with Rajkot Investment Trust Limited (RITL) for the same purpose and in the process, transferred alleged proceeds of crime totalling ₹ 20 crore to it. However, following the arrest of Skyline directors and initiation of criminal proceedings, the funds were not used by RITL. Instead, the company retained the amount and transferred it the accounts of various related persons and entities.

“A part of the proceeds of crime was also withdrawn in cash to obfuscate the trail of funds. The money trail led to the attachment of these POC (proceeds of crime) totalling ₹ 19.39 crore in bank accounts and fixed deposits belonging to Nimisha Finance India Private Limited, Rajkot Investments Trust Limited, Mahananda Investment Limited, Baskin Management Consultancy Private Limited and others,” said the ED.</p>

<h1><b><u>Centre reviews ground rules with Manipur’s Kuki-Zo insurgent groups</u></b></h1>
 <img src=C:\Users\veera\Downloads\MHA.jpg alt="MHA" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
</p>The Union Ministry of Home Affairs is reviewing the ground rules applicable to the Kuki-Zo insurgent groups in Manipur, which are in a Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement with the government since 2008. One of the measures proposed by the Union government is removal of SoO camps from locations close to the valley districts which are dominated by the Meitei people.The camps are proposed to be relocated further inside the hills, said a source.The issue was also discussed on June 17 when Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the security situation in Manipur with State government officials without Chief Minister N. Biren Singh. Meitei groups have been demanding the removal of the camps.According to an estimate, around 2,200 cadres of the SoO groups live in 14 designated camps in the hill districts of Manipur.Ethnic violence between the Kuki-Zo and the Meitei people erupted in Manipur on May 3, 2023 after a tribal solidarity march to protest a court order turned violent in Churachandpur, a hill district. At least 224 people have been killed and more than 60,000 people displaced from their homes in the past 15 months.

In the days before the violence broke in the State, the SoO groups United Peoples’ Front (UPF) and the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) had reached a political settlement with the Ministry to end the decades-old issue. The groups had agreed for a self-governance model in the form of a Territorial Council for the Kuki-Zo in the State of Manipur after several rounds of negotiations. Post-violence, they revised their demand to “separate administration” for the Kuki-Zo people.

Another source said that the present round of meetings, held for the first time since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was sworn-in June, did not discuss the political demands.
